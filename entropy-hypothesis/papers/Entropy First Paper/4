**Title: Rethinking Cosmic Temperature: An Entropy-First Framework for Structure-Dominated Environments**

**Abstract**
We present a novel model of cosmological temperature rooted in entropy structure rather than equilibrium thermodynamics. Drawing from field theory, information theory, and gravitational systems, this framework treats temperature as an emergent property of entropy organization in spacetime. We test this model using real flux data from the Roman Space Telescope mock catalog and derive entropy-based temperatures that scale dynamically across flux and frequency. The results reveal a significant divergence from classical Planck-based blackbody estimates, which flatten at low flux levels. These findings suggest that temperature in deep-field cosmological regimes may be governed by internal field coherence rather than thermally distributed energy. The entropy-first model provides a new lens to interpret faint astronomical signals, black hole interiors, and the entropy-time relationship.

**4. Results**

The results of applying the entropy-first model to Roman mock catalog data are visually and numerically summarized in Figures 59 and 60. These results demonstrate the model's capacity to produce temperature estimates that scale dynamically with flux, in stark contrast to the limited range predicted by Planck-based classical models.

### 4.1 Figure 59 — Divergence in Temperature Estimates
Figure 59 illustrates the first major divergence: temperature as a function of flux under both entropy-based and classical formulations.

- The entropy-first model produced temperatures spanning \(10^{18} - 10^{20}\) K for the faintest flux levels, with coherent, scalable variation.
- The Planck model, by contrast, predicted a nearly flat temperature range (~77–130 K), due to the logarithmic saturation of the Wien approximation at low flux.

This divergence is not a result of error, but of fundamental model difference: entropy-first temperatures respond to *structural field configuration*, while classical temperature relies on *thermodynamic equilibrium*. The dynamic scaling seen in entropy-derived values suggests that traditional radiative transfer models are insufficient in deep-field regimes.

### 4.2 Figure 60 — Frequency-Based Consistency
Figure 60 introduces frequency variability to the Planck estimates, testing whether alternative \( \nu \) values (\(1 \times 10^{13}, 1.8 \times 10^{14}, 3 \times 10^{14}\) Hz) could better match entropy-derived trends.

Results confirmed the opposite:
- Classical Planck-based temperature predictions remain clustered and exhibit minimal sensitivity to frequency changes.
- Entropy-derived temperatures remained continuous and responsive, showing consistent inverse power-law scaling.

This highlights the model's robustness: **entropy-first temperature remains valid across a range of input frequencies**, whereas classical temperature fails to adapt beyond equilibrium constraints.

### 4.3 Empirical Confirmation
The combined results of both figures confirm that:
- The entropy-first formulation produces dynamic, real-data-compatible predictions across multiple observation bands.
- Classical thermodynamics fails to describe the temperature behavior of extremely faint sources, particularly in space-based ultra-deep survey regimes.

These empirical divergences represent not a refutation of Planck’s law, but a **boundary condition** where it ceases to apply. Entropy-first temperature fills that gap, offering a structural thermodynamic tool that scales with both field order and signal strength.

Section 5 will explore the implications of these findings for cosmology, gravitational theory, and future observational strategies.
