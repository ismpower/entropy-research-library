**Title: Rethinking Cosmic Temperature: An Entropy-First Framework for Structure-Dominated Environments**

**Abstract**
We present a novel model of cosmological temperature rooted in entropy structure rather than equilibrium thermodynamics. Drawing from field theory, information theory, and gravitational systems, this framework treats temperature as an emergent property of entropy organization in spacetime. We test this model using real flux data from the Roman Space Telescope mock catalog and derive entropy-based temperatures that scale dynamically across flux and frequency. The results reveal a significant divergence from classical Planck-based blackbody estimates, which flatten at low flux levels. These findings suggest that temperature in deep-field cosmological regimes may be governed by internal field coherence rather than thermally distributed energy. The entropy-first model provides a new lens to interpret faint astronomical signals, black hole interiors, and the entropy-time relationship.

**7. Conclusion**

The entropy-first model redefines temperature not as a fundamental thermodynamic constant, but as a signal of structural entropy within a physical system. This reconceptualization aligns with deep-field cosmological data, gravitational collapse theory, and information-based views of quantum systems.

We have shown that temperature can emerge from entropy configuration, rather than energy intensity—especially in ultra-low flux or curved spacetime conditions. Through direct comparison with classical Planck estimates, the entropy-based model demonstrates superior scaling behavior, frequency robustness, and theoretical coherence.

Key contributions of this work include:
- A generalized entropy-temperature equation that applies to non-equilibrium systems.
- Empirical validation from Roman mock flux data, producing Figures 59 and 60.
- Theoretical connections between entropy saturation, field coherence, and dimensional emergence.

By placing entropy at the heart of temperature, we open new possibilities for interpreting cosmic evolution, black hole interiors, and quantum information flow. The entropy-first model does not replace classical physics, but extends it into domains where structure—not heat—governs reality.

This framework invites testing, invites falsification, and invites reinterpretation of systems long considered too “cold” to contain useful information. In doing so, it aims to shift the thermodynamic conversation toward a model of reality structured by entropy, shaped by geometry, and governed by coherence.
