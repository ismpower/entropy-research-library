**Title: Rethinking Cosmic Temperature: An Entropy-First Framework for Structure-Dominated Environments**

**Abstract**
We present a novel model of cosmological temperature rooted in entropy structure rather than equilibrium thermodynamics. Drawing from field theory, information theory, and gravitational systems, this framework treats temperature as an emergent property of entropy organization in spacetime. We test this model using real flux data from the Roman Space Telescope mock catalog and derive entropy-based temperatures that scale dynamically across flux and frequency. The results reveal a significant divergence from classical Planck-based blackbody estimates, which flatten at low flux levels. These findings suggest that temperature in deep-field cosmological regimes may be governed by internal field coherence rather than thermally distributed energy. The entropy-first model provides a new lens to interpret faint astronomical signals, black hole interiors, and the entropy-time relationship.

**1. Introduction**

Temperature has long been treated as a fundamental quantity in physics—a direct reflection of energy per degree of freedom in a system. However, the emergence of entropy-dominant phenomena such as black holes, early-universe fluctuations, and quantum-coherent systems challenges this classical interpretation. The prevailing assumption that temperature is tightly bound to energy distribution may not hold in environments where field structure dominates over thermal motion.

This work proposes a shift in perspective: that **entropy—not energy—is the fundamental descriptor of physical systems**, and temperature emerges secondarily from its configuration. This entropy-first framework builds on prior research into superconductivity, holography, and statistical mechanics, extending these ideas into gravitational and cosmological contexts. In particular, we argue that entropy-field coherence determines particle behavior and thermal perception at both micro and cosmic scales.

In prior iterations of this project, we developed theoretical tools for describing entropy saturation, decay, and horizon effects—ultimately suggesting that temperature is not a primitive property of energy, but a signal of how energy is structured. The present paper combines those theoretical insights with empirical validation from observational mock data, testing whether entropy-based temperature predictions are consistent with real astronomical flux measurements.

We find that not only does the entropy-first model produce physically plausible results—it **outperforms classical models** in predictive flexibility and alignment with flux-based behavior in ultra-low-signal environments. This lays the groundwork for a testable, falsifiable redefinition of cosmic temperature that may offer new insight into gravitational singularities, deep-field photometry, and entropy-driven physics.
