**Title: Rethinking Cosmic Temperature: An Entropy-First Framework for Structure-Dominated Environments**

**Abstract**
We present a novel model of cosmological temperature rooted in entropy structure rather than equilibrium thermodynamics. Drawing from field theory, information theory, and gravitational systems, this framework treats temperature as an emergent property of entropy organization in spacetime. We test this model using real flux data from the Roman Space Telescope mock catalog and derive entropy-based temperatures that scale dynamically across flux and frequency. The results reveal a significant divergence from classical Planck-based blackbody estimates, which flatten at low flux levels. These findings suggest that temperature in deep-field cosmological regimes may be governed by internal field coherence rather than thermally distributed energy. The entropy-first model provides a new lens to interpret faint astronomical signals, black hole interiors, and the entropy-time relationship.

**1. Introduction**

Temperature has long been treated as a fundamental quantity in physics—a direct reflection of energy per degree of freedom in a system. However, the emergence of entropy-dominant phenomena such as black holes, early-universe fluctuations, and quantum-coherent systems challenges this classical interpretation. The prevailing assumption that temperature is tightly bound to energy distribution may not hold in environments where field structure dominates over thermal motion.

This work proposes a shift in perspective: that **entropy—not energy—is the fundamental descriptor of physical systems**, and temperature emerges secondarily from its configuration. This entropy-first framework builds on prior research into superconductivity, holography, and statistical mechanics, extending these ideas into gravitational and cosmological contexts. In particular, we argue that entropy-field coherence determines particle behavior and thermal perception at both micro and cosmic scales.

In prior iterations of this project, we developed theoretical tools for describing entropy saturation, decay, and horizon effects—ultimately suggesting that temperature is not a primitive property of energy, but a signal of how energy is structured. The present paper combines those theoretical insights with empirical validation from observational mock data, testing whether entropy-based temperature predictions are consistent with real astronomical flux measurements.

We find that not only does the entropy-first model produce physically plausible results—it **outperforms classical models** in predictive flexibility and alignment with flux-based behavior in ultra-low-signal environments. This lays the groundwork for a testable, falsifiable redefinition of cosmic temperature that may offer new insight into gravitational singularities, deep-field photometry, and entropy-driven physics.

**2. The Entropy-First Model**

The entropy-first model is built on the foundational claim that entropy is the most primary organizing principle of physical systems. Unlike energy, which can vary arbitrarily across contexts, entropy always reflects structural change, state accessibility, and the evolution of spacetime information.

We begin by discarding the assumption that temperature is a measurable property of all energy distributions. Instead, we define it as the response of entropy to changes in system energy:

\[ T(E) = \left( \frac{dS}{dE} \right)^{-1} \]

This equation does not assume equilibrium, particle statistics, or thermodynamic constraints. It simply states that temperature is a derived quantity, emerging from how many structural configurations (microstates) are accessible to a given amount of energy.

### 2.1 Structural Entropy Functions
To apply this formulation to real-world scenarios, we developed several entropy evolution functions. One key form—the entropy saturation model—is given by:

\[ S(\tau) = S_\infty (1 - e^{-k\tau}) \]

Where:
- \( S(\tau) \) is entropy as a function of configuration evolution \( \tau \)
- \( S_\infty \) is the maximum entropy capacity of the system
- \( k \) is a structural evolution rate constant

This model captures how systems approach entropic equilibrium without referencing time directly. It has been tested against both simulated decay systems and observational entropy saturation curves.

Inverting this framework allows us to generate temperature functions of energy or flux without relying on particle distributions. For example, using a power-law structural model:

\[ S(E) = k_B \left( \frac{E}{E_0} \right)^\alpha \quad \Rightarrow \quad T(E) = \frac{E_0}{\alpha k_B} \left( \frac{E}{E_0} \right)^{1 - \alpha} \]

This formulation reveals a direct link between entropy structure (via \( \alpha \)) and the emergent thermodynamic signature.

### 2.2 Interpretation of Parameters
- \( \alpha \) reflects the curvature or coherence of the energy structure. High \( \alpha \) values lead to faster entropy growth.
- \( E_0 \) acts as a reference energy scale, potentially linked to cosmic thresholds or measurement constraints.
- \( k_B \) retains its traditional role as the entropy-energy conversion factor.

By analyzing how these parameters interact with flux, redshift, and frequency, the entropy-first model becomes not only mathematically elegant—but empirically testable.

The next section outlines the data and methodology used to evaluate this model using Roman Space Telescope simulation outputs.

**3. Methodology and Data**

To test the entropy-first temperature model, we utilized deep-field simulated photometric data from the Roman Space Telescope ultra-deep mock catalog. The dataset includes redshift (\( z \)), image-plane flux, and apparent magnitudes in the H-band (MAGH, APMAG_H), allowing us to reconstruct a range of faint-object energy states.

### 3.1 Data Preparation

- **Flux Conversion**: AB magnitudes were converted to flux density using the standard relation:

\[ F_\nu (\text{W/m}^2/\text{Hz}) = 10^{-0.4 (\text{mag} + 48.6)} \times 10^{-26} \]

- **Temperature Calculation (Entropy Model)**: The resulting flux values were interpreted as energy inputs to the entropy function:

\[ T_{\text{entropy}} = \frac{E_0}{\alpha k_B} \left( \frac{F_\nu}{E_0} \right)^{1 - \alpha} \]

This formula uses \( \alpha = 1.5 \) and \( E_0 = 10^{-21} \text{W/m}^2/\text{Hz} \) as reference values unless otherwise noted.

- **Temperature Calculation (Planck Model)**: For comparison, Planck-derived temperatures were computed using the Wien approximation of the blackbody formula:

\[ T_{\text{Planck}} \approx \frac{h \nu}{k_B \ln\left(\frac{2h\nu^3}{c^2 F_\nu}\right)} \]

with fixed frequency \( \nu = 1.8 \times 10^{14} \) Hz (H-band) and variants tested at \( \nu = 1 \times 10^{13} \) and \( \nu = 3 \times 10^{14} \) Hz.

### 3.2 Tools and Reproducibility

All calculations were performed using Python with `numpy`, `pandas`, and `matplotlib`. Custom functions for entropy-based temperature were written to accommodate arbitrary flux inputs and parameter sets. Outputs were saved as CSV tables and plotted in log-log space to observe functional scaling.

Scripts used:
- `Entropy Energy Temperature_1.0` to `2.1`
- Data extraction and model fitting pipelines
- Figure generation for all empirical comparisons (Figures 59 and 60)

Section 4 will present the results of these calculations and their implications for entropy-structured field interpretations.
