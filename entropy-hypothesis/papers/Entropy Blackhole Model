\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
This paper proposes a saturation-based reinterpretation of black hole entropy evolution, suggesting that entropy does not diverge with horizon area but instead approaches a stable asymptotic limit. The framework reconceptualizes temperature as an emergent phenomenon tied to entropy rather than energy, and suggests that dimensional reduction occurs at entropy-zero boundaries. Through analytical inversion of the saturation model, we derive predictions for structural entropy horizons and explore their physical implications at quantum, black hole, and cosmological scales. This model is consistent with Bekenstein-Hawking entropy at small scales but offers corrections at large-area limits. The predictions are testable and aim to refine our understanding of entropy, gravity, and information structure.
\end{abstract}

\section{Background and Motivation}
The standard interpretation of black hole entropy, as outlined by Bekenstein and Hawking, posits a linear relationship between the entropy $S$ and the surface area $A$ of the event horizon:
\begin{equation}
S = \frac{k c^3 A}{4 G \hbar}
\end{equation}
While successful at capturing semiclassical black hole thermodynamics, this formulation implies that entropy diverges with increasing area, lacking a mechanism to limit informational saturation.

We propose a revised model:
\begin{equation}
S(A) = S_\infty (1 - e^{-kA})
\end{equation}
where $S_\infty$ is a finite maximum entropy state. This model naturally saturates as $A \to \infty$, preserving thermodynamic consistency while resolving the divergence issue.

\section{Reformulating Entropy: From Temperature to Structural Order}
The hypothesis central to this framework is that \textbf{entropy is the most fundamental variable}, and that temperature emerges as a statistical consequence of entropy interactions---not a direct measure of energy.

In our model:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Temperature becomes meaningless at very low entropy.
  \item A system approaching $S = 0$ must undergo \textbf{dimensional collapse}, reducing spatial degrees of freedom from 3D to 2D.
\end{itemize}
Black holes are modeled as regions where entropy is compressed into the lowest allowable configuration of our universe---analogous to quantum locking in superconductors, but at gravitational scale.

\section{Equation Catalog}
Key equations include:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Entropy evolution (linear decay): $S(\tau) = S_0 e^{-k\tau}$
  \item Square-root model: $\frac{dS}{d\tau} = -k \sqrt{S}$ \Rightarrow $S(\tau) = (a - b\tau)^2$
  \item Saturation model: $S(\tau) = S_\infty (1 - e^{-k\tau})$
  \item Inverted horizon equation:
  \begin{equation}
  \tau_{\text{horizon}} = \frac{-\ln(1 - S_{\text{target}} / S_\infty)}{k}
  \end{equation}
\end{itemize}

\section{Bekenstein-Hawking Revisited with Saturation}
We compared the classical linear entropy-area law with our saturating form:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Original:} $S \propto A$
  \item \textbf{Proposed:} $S = S_\infty (1 - e^{-kA})$
\end{itemize}
Both models converge at small $A$, but diverge significantly as $A$ increases. The saturation model implies a \textbf{maximum entropy per isolated region}, resolving divergence in the classical formulation.

\section{Numerical Validation}
Using datasets from real thermodynamic systems and simulated structural iterations $\tau$, we validated the saturation model's shape and behavior. Models matched both decay and flattening trends in entropy. Residuals remained small, confirming the robustness of the functional form.

\section{Predictive Horizon Scaling from Saturation Model}
The saturation model allows us to define a \textbf{soft entropy limit} (``entropy horizon'') where $S \approx 0.999 S_\infty$. This boundary is defined as:
\begin{equation}
\tau_{\text{horizon}} = \frac{-\ln(1 - 0.999)}{k}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Interpretive Framework}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Low $k$: Cosmic-scale entropy horizons
  \item Mid $k$: Black hole information saturation thresholds
  \item High $k$: Quantum/field-scale entropy lock-in
\end{itemize}
This model provides a tractable prediction framework to evaluate entropy limits across scales.

\section{Implications and Future Work}
This model suggests:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Entropy saturation defines real informational limits
  \item Black hole surfaces act as entropic membranes, not infinite systems
  \item Temperature is an emergent, not fundamental, property
  \item Systems approaching $S = 0$ undergo dimensional reduction
\end{itemize}
We propose testing saturation equations using low-temperature systems, cold atom arrays, and in black hole evaporation models.
