# Goal: Find a correlation between average temperature of the universe, its age, and Hubble constant
# Hypothesis: Our entropy-first model should align with existing cosmological constants in a way that forms a meaningful relation

# Constants
k_B = 1.380649e-23         # Boltzmann constant (J/K)
h = 6.62607015e-34         # Planck constant (JÂ·s)
c = 299792458              # Speed of light (m/s)
G = 6.67430e-11            # Gravitational constant (m^3 kg^-1 s^-2)
sigma = 5.670374419e-8     # Stefan-Boltzmann constant (W/m^2/K^4)

# Cosmological data
T_universe = 2.725          # Average temperature of the observable universe in Kelvin
age_universe_yr = 13.8e9    # Age of the universe in years
age_universe_s = age_universe_yr * 365.25 * 24 * 3600
H0_km_s_Mpc = 70            # Hubble constant in km/s/Mpc

# Convert Hubble constant to 1/s
H0 = H0_km_s_Mpc * 1000 / (3.085677581e22)  # in s^-1

# Estimate total energy density using blackbody approximation
# u = a * T^4, where a = 4 * sigma / c (radiation constant)
a_rad = 4 * sigma / c
energy_density = a_rad * T_universe**4  # J/m^3

# Estimate entropy density of the universe (approximation):
# s = (4/3) * a * T^3
entropy_density = (4/3) * a_rad * T_universe**3  # J/K/m^3

# Try to find a derived quantity combining entropy density, age, and Hubble
# Define a "cosmic entropy correlation factor" as:
#   CECF = (entropy_density * age_universe_s * H0) => dimensionless-ish
cosmic_entropy_factor = entropy_density * age_universe_s * H0

# This is just a first step. If this value is consistent across other cosmic values,
# it might reveal a deeper structural constant related to entropy-time-expansion.
