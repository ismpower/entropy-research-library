# üî¨ Unified Abstract: Entropy-First Temperature in Cosmological Context

This study presents a novel comparison between classical thermodynamic models and a proposed entropy-first framework for interpreting cosmological temperature. Using observational mock data from the Roman Space Telescope, we derive temperatures from deep-field flux measurements and evaluate the results across models.

In the classical interpretation, temperature is estimated through Planck's radiation law, assuming blackbody equilibrium. In contrast, the entropy-first model defines temperature as an emergent property of energy organization and entropy structure‚Äîone not strictly determined by energy magnitude, but by its configurational order within spacetime.

## Key Findings:
- Entropy-derived temperatures show dynamic, non-linear scaling with flux and persist at extreme low-flux levels, revealing field coherence rather than thermal equilibrium.
- Planck-derived estimates flatten quickly across the same data, showing insensitivity to deep-field signal variation.
- Multi-frequency tests reveal further limitations in classical scaling, while the entropy-first model maintains continuity and responsiveness across all regimes.

## Figure Captions

**Figure 59 ‚Äî Empirical Divergence Between Classical and Entropy-First Temperature Estimates**  
This figure visualizes real flux measurements from the Roman Space Telescope mock catalog, translated into temperature using two distinct physical frameworks:

- The **entropy-first model**, which defines temperature as a consequence of entropy-field structure rather than direct energy intensity.
- The **classical Planck model**, applying the Wien approximation to infer temperature from flux under equilibrium assumptions.

The results show a striking divergence: entropy-based temperatures scale continuously and nonlinearly with flux, while Planck-based estimates remain nearly static, hovering around a narrow thermal band regardless of flux variation. This contrast highlights the limitations of classical blackbody models when applied to ultra-faint cosmological sources.

The entropy-first model, by contrast, reveals a high-temperature structure across flux levels, suggesting that temperature is not solely tied to emission density, but instead emerges from the internal coherence and organization of energy fields within spacetime.

These results support a departure from traditional thermodynamic interpretations of cosmic temperature, favoring a model in which temperature emerges from entropy configuration, particularly in deep-field or non-equilibrium contexts.

**Figure 60 ‚Äî Divergence Between Classical and Entropy-Based Temperature Models Across Flux and Frequency**  
This figure compares temperatures derived from two fundamentally different models using real astronomical data from the Roman Space Telescope mock catalog:

- The **entropy-first model**, which treats temperature as an emergent result of field structure and energy organization, not as a direct function of flux.
- The **Planck (classical blackbody) model**, which interprets flux through the lens of equilibrium thermodynamics and radiation law, shown here using the Wien approximation across three frequency bands.

Despite overlapping input data, the temperature curves diverge significantly. The entropy-based model yields high, scale-sensitive temperatures even at extremely low flux densities‚Äîsuggesting that thermodynamic equilibrium is not a sufficient descriptor of deep-field signal structure. Classical Planck-based estimates, in contrast, flatten quickly and exhibit minimal variation across flux or frequency once saturation sets in.

This empirical result supports the hypothesis that temperature in cosmological environments is not a primitive thermodynamic property, but rather a product of the underlying entropy structure of spacetime and energy configuration. The entropy-first formulation offers a more dynamic interpretation of faint signals that may reflect the true energetic order of the early or distant universe.
