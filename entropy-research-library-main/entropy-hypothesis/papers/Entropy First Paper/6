**Title: Rethinking Cosmic Temperature: An Entropy-First Framework for Structure-Dominated Environments**

**Abstract**
We present a novel model of cosmological temperature rooted in entropy structure rather than equilibrium thermodynamics. Drawing from field theory, information theory, and gravitational systems, this framework treats temperature as an emergent property of entropy organization in spacetime. We test this model using real flux data from the Roman Space Telescope mock catalog and derive entropy-based temperatures that scale dynamically across flux and frequency. The results reveal a significant divergence from classical Planck-based blackbody estimates, which flatten at low flux levels. These findings suggest that temperature in deep-field cosmological regimes may be governed by internal field coherence rather than thermally distributed energy. The entropy-first model provides a new lens to interpret faint astronomical signals, black hole interiors, and the entropy-time relationship.

**6. Future Work**

While the entropy-first model has shown theoretical and empirical validity, it also opens several new questions. The path forward includes both experimental refinement and deeper theoretical synthesis.

### 6.1 Empirical Validation
- **Redshift correction**: Future work will incorporate source-frame redshift corrections (using \( z \)) to test whether entropy-derived temperature holds in comoving coordinates.
- **Multi-band validation**: Observations from JWST, Euclid, or future Roman deep surveys can test the frequency-stability of entropy-based scaling.
- **Lab-scale calibration**: Experiments in doppler cooling and superconducting systems may help calibrate entropy structural constants (\( \alpha \), \( k \), \( E_0 \)) under controlled conditions.
- **Entropy decay matching**: Comparing black hole evaporation curves to entropy horizon models may reveal scaling analogies and test decay dynamics.

### 6.2 Theoretical Expansion
- **Integration with Einstein field equations**: A reformulation of the stress-energy tensor in terms of structural entropy could link this work directly to General Relativity.
- **Dimensional emergence**: Further modeling may explore whether spatial dimensions (e.g., 2D surfaces inside black holes) emerge from entropy minima.
- **Quantum information alignment**: Since entropy is the foundation of quantum information, future work should test how this model aligns with known entanglement entropy and decoherence behavior.
- **Arrow of time derivation**: Entropy-first models may offer a new derivation for time’s asymmetry based on saturation dynamics.

### 6.3 Experimental Predictions
- **Detectable curvature in deep-field photometry**: If entropy-based temperature is correct, faint signals will show non-classical scaling in high-resolution surveys.
- **Black hole radiation asymmetries**: An entropy-first view may predict structured, non-thermal radiation characteristics not explainable via equilibrium.
- **Saturation plateau thresholds**: Observables may emerge where flux shows a flat but non-zero entropy temperature signature—indicating maximal configuration density.

This model is intended to be testable and falsifiable. Its strength lies not in discarding classical physics, but in extending it into the entropy-dominated regime where field structure—not thermal energy—governs the behavior of systems.

Section 7 will conclude with a summary of the paradigm shift and the broader implications for cosmology and theoretical physics.
