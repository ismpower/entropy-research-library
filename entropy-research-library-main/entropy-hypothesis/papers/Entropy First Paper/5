**Title: Rethinking Cosmic Temperature: An Entropy-First Framework for Structure-Dominated Environments**

**Abstract**
We present a novel model of cosmological temperature rooted in entropy structure rather than equilibrium thermodynamics. Drawing from field theory, information theory, and gravitational systems, this framework treats temperature as an emergent property of entropy organization in spacetime. We test this model using real flux data from the Roman Space Telescope mock catalog and derive entropy-based temperatures that scale dynamically across flux and frequency. The results reveal a significant divergence from classical Planck-based blackbody estimates, which flatten at low flux levels. These findings suggest that temperature in deep-field cosmological regimes may be governed by internal field coherence rather than thermally distributed energy. The entropy-first model provides a new lens to interpret faint astronomical signals, black hole interiors, and the entropy-time relationship.

**5. Discussion**

The entropy-first temperature model does more than reinterpret a single physical quantity—it offers a conceptual reorganization of thermodynamics in field-based, relativistic, and cosmological regimes. The divergence from classical Planck behavior is not merely quantitative but structural: entropy-based temperature reflects how energy is organized, not how much of it exists.

### 5.1 Structural Temperature and Cosmic Interpretation
In faint, distant, or highly curved spacetimes (such as near black holes or at high redshift), the assumption of thermodynamic equilibrium breaks down. Classical temperature loses its meaning when there is no thermal bath or local particle population to define it.

Under this model:
- **Temperature becomes an information-based signal**—the response of an entropic system to energy flux.
- **Deep-field cosmology** can now interpret faint light not in terms of cold radiation, but high-entropy coherence.
- **Gravitationally bound systems** (e.g., black holes) may exhibit extreme temperature not because of high energy, but because of low entropy structural states.

This interpretation aligns with both gravitational collapse theory and quantum decoherence behavior, especially where entropy saturation or horizon phenomena are involved.

### 5.2 Implications for Black Hole Thermodynamics
In classical physics, black holes paradoxically exhibit both extreme entropy (via the Bekenstein-Hawking formula) and undefined internal temperatures. The entropy-first model resolves this tension:
- Black hole cores can be modeled as **entropy minima**, stabilized by quantum structural coherence.
- Outward radiation (e.g., Hawking radiation) reflects entropy leakage, not classical thermal emission.
- The “temperature” of a black hole is not a thermal surface value, but an emergent signature of internal entropy topology.

This offers a pathway to reconcile quantum field behavior with curved spacetime by treating entropy as the universal constraint linking both domains.

### 5.3 Toward a General Framework
By redefining temperature through structural entropy, the model:
- Integrates **quantum mechanical coherence**, **information entropy**, and **gravitational curvature** in one framework.
- Explains previously “cold” deep-space observations as entropy-dense configurations.
- Suggests that **time**, **temperature**, and **dimension** are all emergent properties of entropic behavior—not fundamental coordinates.

In short, entropy-first physics treats energy as a raw ingredient, and entropy as the sculptor that turns it into observable structure. The observed temperature is simply a surface signal of that hidden architecture.

Section 6 will outline open questions and future avenues of research to test, refine, or challenge this framework.
