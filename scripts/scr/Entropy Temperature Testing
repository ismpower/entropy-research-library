# Placeholder for equations and logic testing the entropy-temperature relationship
# in scenarios without classical spacetime constraints.

# For now, the canvas is reserved for simulation-style or analytical approaches
# that assume degrees of freedom collapse (DOF -> 2) and entropy remains measurable
# even in absence of a well-defined temporal or spatial field.

# We can explore:
# - Entropy as a standalone variable with no associated thermodynamic time
# - Field configurations that evolve purely by entropy gradient, not heat
# - Temperature as an emergent ratio (if meaningful at all)

# Let's define symbolic placeholders:
from sympy import symbols, Eq, limit, oo

S, E, V, T, DOF = symbols('S E V T DOF')

# Traditional thermodynamic identity (for comparison only):
# T = dE/dS, or rearranged:
T_eq = Eq(T, 1 / (E.diff(S)))

# Your entropic dimensional collapse condition:
entropy_collapse = Eq(limit(DOF, S, 0), 2)

# Placeholder entropy-only evolution equation (spacetime-less):
# Consider entropy as a driver of curvature:
# dS/dx ~ d^2g_mu_nu

print("Testing theoretical framework without spacetime:")
print("Temperature identity (traditional, spacetime-bound):", T_eq)
print("Dimensional collapse at entropy zero:", entropy_collapse)

# Future steps:
# Define what a system's evolution looks like when time and space are emergent
# All updates driven by entropic delta functions

# Notes:
# - Heat disappears as a mechanism
# - Motion (kinetic energy) is undefined
# - Entropy remains, perhaps as a function of structural phase state
