**Figure 59 â€” Empirical Divergence Between Classical and Entropy-First Temperature Estimates**

This figure visualizes real flux measurements from the Roman Space Telescope mock catalog, translated into temperature using two distinct physical frameworks:

- The **entropy-first model**, which defines temperature as a consequence of entropy-field structure rather than direct energy intensity.
- The **classical Planck model**, applying the Wien approximation to infer temperature from flux under equilibrium assumptions.

The results show a striking divergence: entropy-based temperatures scale continuously and nonlinearly with flux, while Planck-based estimates remain nearly static, hovering around a narrow thermal band regardless of flux variation. This contrast highlights the limitations of classical blackbody models when applied to ultra-faint cosmological sources.

The entropy-first model, by contrast, reveals a high-temperature structure across flux levels, suggesting that temperature is not solely tied to emission density, but instead emerges from the internal coherence and organization of energy fields within spacetime.

These results support a departure from traditional thermodynamic interpretations of cosmic temperature, favoring a model in which temperature emerges from entropy configuration, particularly in deep-field or non-equilibrium contexts.
