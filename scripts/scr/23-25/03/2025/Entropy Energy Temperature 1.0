# üìò Entropy-First Model: Deriving Energy-Temperature Relations
# üìÇ Script Name: Entropy Energy Temperature_1.0

# Constants
k_B = 1.380649e-23  # Boltzmann constant (J/K)
c = 299792458       # Speed of light (m/s)
h = 6.62607015e-34  # Planck constant (J*s)

# Foundational Assumptions (Entropy-First Framework):
# 1. Entropy (S) is treated as the fundamental descriptor of any system.
# 2. Temperature (T) is emergent and only meaningful in the presence of energy distribution.
# 3. Energy (E) exists as the field excitation structured by entropy, not as an independent primitive.

# Start with statistical thermodynamics:
# Traditional: S = k_B * ln(W)  =>  entropy is a measure of state multiplicity

# Postulate 1: Define entropy in terms of energy field coherence:
# For a system governed by coherent field states:
# S = k_B * ln(Œ©(E)) where Œ©(E) is the count of distinguishable energy field configurations

# Goal: Derive T(E) from dS/dE (temperature as a derivative)
# By entropy-first:
#   1/T = dS/dE  =>  T(E) = 1 / (dS/dE)
# The shape of S(E) dictates the thermodynamic evolution

# Hypothesis-based example:
def entropy_field_model(E, alpha=1.5, E0=1e-21):
    """
    Hypothetical entropy function based on energy coherence decay.
    S(E) = k_B * (E / E0)^alpha  
    This represents entropy as a power-law growth of distinguishable energy states.
    """
    from numpy import power, log
    return k_B * power(E / E0, alpha)

def temperature_from_entropy(E, alpha=1.5, E0=1e-21):
    """
    Derived temperature function: T(E) = 1 / (dS/dE)
    where S(E) = k_B * (E / E0)^alpha
    => dS/dE = alpha * k_B / E0 * (E / E0)^(alpha - 1)
    => T(E) = E0 / (alpha * k_B * (E / E0)^(alpha - 1))
    """
    from numpy import power
    dSdE = alpha * k_B / E0 * power(E / E0, alpha - 1)
    return 1 / dSdE

# This equation allows comparison to observational data (e.g. CMB, blackbody curves)

# ‚ùì Questions to Explore:
# 1. Does this entropy-driven formulation predict known cosmic background behavior?
# 2. Can deviations from Planck radiation law at quantum limits be explained via entropy curvature?
# 3. Is there a critical entropy threshold below which temperature becomes undefined?
