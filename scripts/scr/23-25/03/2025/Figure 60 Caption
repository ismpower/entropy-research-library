**Figure 60 — Divergence Between Classical and Entropy-Based Temperature Models Across Flux and Frequency**

This figure compares temperatures derived from two fundamentally different models using real astronomical data from the Roman Space Telescope mock catalog:

- The **entropy-first model**, which treats temperature as an emergent result of field structure and energy organization, not as a direct function of flux.
- The **Planck (classical blackbody) model**, which interprets flux through the lens of equilibrium thermodynamics and radiation law, shown here using the Wien approximation across three frequency bands.

Despite overlapping input data, the temperature curves diverge significantly. The entropy-based model yields high, scale-sensitive temperatures even at extremely low flux densities—suggesting that thermodynamic equilibrium is not a sufficient descriptor of deep-field signal structure. Classical Planck-based estimates, in contrast, flatten quickly and exhibit minimal variation across flux or frequency once saturation sets in.

This empirical result supports the hypothesis that temperature in cosmological environments is not a primitive thermodynamic property, but rather a product of the underlying entropy structure of spacetime and energy configuration. The entropy-first formulation offers a more dynamic interpretation of faint signals that may reflect the true energetic order of the early or distant universe.

This marks a key departure from conventional thermal models, opening the door to new temperature definitions rooted in structural information rather than energy density alone.
