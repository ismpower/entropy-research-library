# Entropy Research Library

This repository contains all code, data, and documentation related to the exploration of entropy-based gravitational collapse, culminating in the proposed **Chajar Constant** and a novel thermodynamic boundary condition for black hole interiors.

---

## 🔭 Project Highlights

- Introduces the **Chajar Constant** as a critical entropy-to-temperature threshold
- Demonstrates entropy collapse via surface encoding, consistent with holographic principles
- Includes reproducible simulations for:
  - Neutron star and black hole entropy
  - Chajar limit calculations
  - Surface vs volumetric entropy density comparisons
- Full paper draft written in LaTeX included in `/latex`

## 🛠️ Installation

To run the simulations, make sure you have **Python 3.10+** and install the following dependencies:

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib
```

If using Jupyter Notebooks:

```bash
pip install jupyter
```

---

## 📄 Usage

Clone the repository and run any script from the `/scripts` folder:

```bash
python scripts/Entropy_Collapse_Test.py
```

All figures and data outputs will be saved in `/results` or `/figures`.

## 📘 Paper and Documentation

The scientific paper draft is located in `/latex`:
```
Entropy_Collapse_Paper.tex
```

You can compile it using `pdflatex`, Overleaf, or Visual Studio Code with LaTeX Workshop extension.
